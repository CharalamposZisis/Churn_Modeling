# Churn_Modeling

In this project, I gained my first practical experience with TensorFlow by building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for binary classification. I used the Kaggle Churn Modelling dataset to predict whether a bank client will exit or remain with the bank (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aakash50897/churn-modellingcsv/data).

After preprocessing and feature scaling, I constructed a multi-layer neural network with ReLU and sigmoid activations. The model achieved approximately 85% test accuracy. Through this exercise, I practiced about data preparation, model design, and evaluation metrics for classification problems.

ðŸ”§ Possible Improvements

Future work could include hyperparameter tuning, class balancing, and exploring alternative architectures like deeper networks or ensemble methods.
I would also like to experiment with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS) to scale up computation, rather than relying solely on my local laptop.
